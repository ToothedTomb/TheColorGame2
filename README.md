# TheColorGame2
The improved color game.

You need to pick what color the text is but be warned the text will say a different color and may trick you! Do you have what it takes to get 100 points in 100 seconds or even 50 seconds? Or if you want a better challenge 30 seconds. 

You will need to be really fast in getting the answer. :) 

This game is in BETA - Only on Linux!!!

Platforms Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS!!!
